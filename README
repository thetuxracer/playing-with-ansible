Just fooling around with Ansible, trying to learn this stuff. A lot of this is
similar to Chef.

To kick this up:

$ vagrant up
$ ssh-copy-id vagrant@10.0.0.10 # do the same for 10.0.0.11, 12

If you dont want to copy the ssh-keys, the production inventory shows how to
let ansible know to ssh into the hosts
